This is my personal website! It's a work in progress...

I have a web of things related to me as the main thing you see when you go to my website (click around to check it out!). I have an About Me, Summary, Projects, Achievements, Involvements, some of my writing and some fun stuff! 

There's some secret pages (like the one when you click 20-page document), and the two cool things hidden at the bottom under "Fun". One is my favourite game, Gomoku, or Five in a Row, which I coded in JavaScript. The other is a place to recommend me songs on Spotify by pasting a link or writing the song name, which automatically adds it to my playlist titled "Recommendations"! Feel free to give me any song recommendations!

In the bottom right corner, there is a button that when clicked, expands to a chatbot based from GeminiAPI. I gave it a lot of information and it's supposed to represent me. In the future I will probably train my own model and fine-tune it with my text messages. 

The the top right corner, there is an Ignite Theme button, this changes the whole mode into dark mode for the dark mode lovers, and changes the background colour to my other favourite colour, blue! While in dark mode, press the "Spray" button in the top right again to go back to light mode.

### How I made it
This website is coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and hosted on Vercel. 

The web uses Three.js, a 3D graphics library along with Three.js examples for the 3D text of my name. It also uses 3D Force Graph to create the network of nodes and links which conects all the boxes of images to my name.

The Five in a Row game is made completely in JavaScript with styling from CSS.

The spotify recommender is made with Spotify API to add songs to my "Recommendations" playlist (it will expire March 3rd since I don't have Spotify Premium 🥲) and there is also a playlist embed.

The chatbot uses GeminiAPI with a prompt feeding it information about me, but I'm currently working on feeding it my text messages as well so it also speaks more like me too! 

### Things I may add in the future:
- perfect the writing parts and make it more visually appealing
- add a dynamic (pink) sky background with clouds (so I can work on my design skills as well)
- Secret background special effects for holidays and special days (there's currently one for Valentine's Day, but you'll have to wait until then to see it again!)
- write up the section about all the hackathons I have been to
- maybe have a blog where I just write about my life
- put my guitar videos up in the Music section under "Fun"
- create a bot that plays Five in a Row like me (and train it on my past games), I don't want it to be good, just that it plays like me
- Maybe I will also try and create a Five in a Row bot that is unbeatable too...
